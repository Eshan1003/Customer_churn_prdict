# Customer_churn_prdict
A machine learning project that predicts customer churn to help businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.


Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

In this project, I analyzed the Telco Customer Churn dataset to build a predictive model that identifies customers likely to discontinue a service. The workflow involved comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior patterns, followed by data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

I implemented multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict churn. Each model was evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robust performance. The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

This project demonstrated practical knowledge in supervised learning, model evaluation, and business insight extraction to support customer retention strategies.

Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses aiming to retain customers and reduce revenue loss. This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data. By identifying customers at risk, businesses can develop targeted retention strategies.

Problem Statement
Customer churn refers to customers discontinuing their relationship with a company’s product or service. Predicting churn accurately helps in minimizing loss and maximizing customer lifetime value. The challenge is to create a model that can classify customers as churned or retained with high accuracy.

Objectives
To analyze customer behavior and identify key factors influencing churn.

To build and optimize machine learning models to predict customer churn.

To interpret model results and provide actionable business insights.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer information such as:

Demographics (age, gender, etc.)

Account details (subscription type, tenure, payment methods)

Service usage patterns

Customer support interactions

Churn status (target variable)

The data includes both numerical and categorical features, with some missing or inconsistent values that require preprocessing.

Data Preprocessing
Handling missing data through imputation or removal.

Encoding categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

Feature scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

Balancing the dataset if it’s imbalanced using methods such as SMOTE or undersampling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing churn distribution and demographic profiles.

Analyzing correlations between features and churn.

Identifying key features with the highest impact on churn using statistical tests and plots.

Modeling Approach
Baseline models: Logistic Regression for interpretability.

Tree-based models: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost).

Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search or Random Search to improve model performance.

Cross-validation for reliable performance estimation.

Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.

classification report

Results and Insights
The best-performing model achieved an F1-score of XX% and ROC-AUC of XX%.

Key churn predictors included tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and customer service calls.

Insights suggest that customers with shorter tenure and higher service complaints have a higher churn risk.

Tools and Technologies
